I try to dedicate a few hours a week to mentoring and teaching minorities in tech.
If you or someone you know is new to the industry and looking for a mentor, is trying to make their next move, or is
just looking for some general advice, please feel free to reach out. I can't promise my advice
will be any good but I am happy to be a sounding board or sanity-check!

If I don't have the capacity to help you personally, I will refer you to someone I trust who I hope
would be a good match.

I occasionally write tutorials aimed a newbies. These are free to use and distribute (so long
as they are credited). I also take requests... with no promises that they will be done (but it doesn't
hurt to ask).
